In this round, player 2 will receive a profit 0.0. But obviously, player 2 wants to make a profit, too, so we take a look at round 2. In this round, player 2 receives a profit of 1.0 and player 1 receives a profit of 9.0. But player 1 obviously wants his profit to be as high as possible. If we look at round 1, player 1 receives a profit of (approximately) 9.1, which is higher than the 9.0 profit of round 2. So, the game will end at round 1."
